OBSERVER PATTERN
================
Defines one to many dependencies between objects
so that when one object (observable) changes its state
all of its dependencies (observers) are notified and updated.

Observable is being observed by observers. 
Observable send notifications when its state changes.
Observers need to subscribe in order to be notified.
