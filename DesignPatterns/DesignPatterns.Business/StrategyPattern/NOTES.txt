STRATEGY PATTERN
================
1. Defines a family of algorithms (concrete strategies - Reverser or Sorted behaviours)
   encapsulate each one (methods within the concrete strategies)
   and makes them interchangeable (they're of type IStrategy)
   and thus strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
   the client (Context class) that use it
