STRATEGY PATTERN
================
Defines a family of strategies (Reverser or Sorted order / Upper and Lower case display)
encapsulate each one (methods within the concrete strategies)
and makes them interchangeable (they're of type ISort / IDisplay)
and thus strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
the client (Context class) that use them.
